AngularJSFlaskTest
==================

Test project using Python Flask and AngularJS

This project was created while reading through 'Instant AngularJS Starter' by Dan Menard.

This project uses Python Flask as the WebServer and even though there are no server side
components it does show how to create a simple AngularJS App with Flask.
